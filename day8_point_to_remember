Layout Widgets:


Point to Remember:
1. Row and Column are two of the most commonly used layouts pattern.
2. Row and Column each take a list of child widgets.
3.  A child widget can itself be a Row, Column or other Complex widget. 
4. You can specify alignment of children.
5. You can stretch or constrain specific child widgets.
6. You can specify how child widgets use the Row’s or Columns’ available space.

Always Parent widget decides the size and position of the Child. 


Widgets Types.

As we all know the flutter app consist of widgets only, these are broadly classified into tow types:

1. Stateless widget
2. Stateful widgets

Stateless Widget:
1. Stateless widgets are immutable.
2. Its appearance and properties remain unchanged throughout the lifetime of the widget. 
3. In simple words, Stateless widgets cannot change their state during the runtime of the app.
4. which means the widgets cannot be redrawn while the app is in action.
